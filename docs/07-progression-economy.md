# Progression, Points, Unlocks

## Goals
- Make repeated runs feel rewarding.
- Keep meta lightweight (prototype).

## Points
- Primary score: total points for the run.
- Record: best score and top N scores.

## Unlocks (post-MVP)
Unlocks are desired (cosmetic + possible gameplay), but are **out of MVP**. Focus MVP on the core sim + presentation.

Post-MVP unlock ideas:
- “Intel” reveals: show hidden individual traits/weaknesses (and pre-existing injuries) on the Round Offer.
- Cosmetic palettes, new arenas, new species.

## MVP scope
- No unlocks required.
- Leaderboard + best score are enough to start.

## Anti-grind
- Avoid currencies.
- Unlocks are binary flags.

## Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- Leaderboard persists locally.
